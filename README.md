What is Green Intelligent Building?![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83089495/158243787-0532db3f-8a2b-4992-b4b2-2204ddb211d3.png)
Green buildings are about resource efficiency, lifecycle effects and building performance. Intelligent buildings, whose core is integrated building technology systems, are about construction and operational efficiencies and enhanced management and occupant functions.
Reduces Wastage of Energy.​
Conserves Natural Resources.​
Improves Air and Water Quality.​
Reduces Costs and Increase Value.​

To design a Smart Prediction, Monitoring and Control System for Intelligent near Zero Green Buildings.

Major Objectives:
Designing a RES generation and consumption system for Intelligent Green Building.
Designing a cloud based Monitoring, Prediction & Control system.
To help user get more profit from electricity exchange with help of ML.

Minor Objectives:
Design Dashboards for several flows so that user gets clear idea of the stats.
Electricity Tariff prediction so that system is able to supply electricity in peak hours to gain profit.
Designing smart algorithm to achieve near zero green building.

A 3 store building has been considered for this paper which have 5 flats and other amenities such as parking, control room and as usual corridors & staircase. All the appliances in each flat are considered as an average household have and same has been done for working hours of those appliances.
Chennai is considered as the location of the building and according to that all the calculations has been done and assumptions has been taken.
As the load ratings are high for a single phase AC, so 3-phase AC bus is considered for the building’s load.
